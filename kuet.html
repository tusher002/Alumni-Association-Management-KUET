  </br>This is a renowned university for the study of engineering in Bangladesh.</br>
  Khulna University of Engineering & Technology (KUET), which started functioning from September 2003, is one of the five
  engineering universities of Bangladesh in higher education, research and development in engineering and technology.
  This university was established as Khulna Engineering College in 1974; the college was later converted to a degree-awarding
  autonomous institution called Bangladesh Institute of Technology (BIT), Khulna in July 1986 through a government ordinance (No. XXI, 1986).
  The institute was upgraded and renamed as Khulna University of Engineering and Technology in September 2003 under the Khulna
  University of Engineering and Technology Act, 2003. KUET is financed by the government through the University Grants Commission. The
